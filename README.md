# The Last Cowboy - Stardew Valley inspired Game in Java

This is a game project developed in Java for the UTFPR Programming Techniques (OOP) subject. The game is inspired by Stardew Valley, a popular farming simulation game. In this game, the player will have to kill different enemies that will be on the player path.

## How to Play
When you start the game, you will be greeted with a main menu. From here, you can start a new game, load a saved game, see the rank, or exit the game.
